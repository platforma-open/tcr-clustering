#!/usr/bin/env Rscript
# GLIPH2 (turboGliph) runner for the tcr-clustering GLIPH2 + Leiden engine.
#
# Builds the GLIPH2 CDR3 similarity network from unique CDR3b (+ optional gene-level TRBV). The
# downstream Leiden partition (python) turns that network into one cluster per sequence. library()
# only — the deps come from the image, never install here.
#
# Input CSV (built by the workflow's prep step) — column names are the stable contract, kept
# INSIDE this script:
#   * `CDR3b` — the CDR3 amino-acid sequence (one row per unique clustering key). Always present.
#   * `TRBV`  — gene-level V gene (e.g. TRBV7-2). Present ONLY for the "+ V gene" option; when it is
#               present GLIPH2 requires the same V gene for global edges (global_vgene = TRUE,
#               gene-level, per the MILAB-6495 GLIPH2+Leiden engine decision). Absent = CDR3-only.
#
# TWO EXECUTION PATHS:
#   * standard — one gliph2() run on the whole input; writes ALL connection edges (global + local).
#     This is the original behaviour and stays exact.
#   * fast (per-V partition, GLOBAL-only) — used ONLY when TRBV is present AND the unique count
#     exceeds FAST_THRESHOLD. GLIPH2's global step is ~O(n^2.8) in the unique count, so it becomes
#     intractable at ~>600k (a full run can take hours / OOM). With global_vgene = TRUE a global
#     edge can only join two SAME-V-gene CDR3s, so splitting the input by full TRBV and running
#     GLIPH2 per partition yields the IDENTICAL global edge set (verified loss-free: ARI 1.0 vs a
#     full run through Leiden at 200k/500k) while collapsing the cost (each partition is ~n/k, and
#     the total work is Sum (n/k)^2.8 << n^2.8). We keep GLOBAL edges only — the per-partition local
#     (motif) enrichment sees a smaller background and is NOT comparable across partitions; global
#     edges dominate the clustering anyway (ARI ~0.95 vs the full global+local run). This path does
#     NOT apply to CDR3-only mode: there global edges cross V genes, so partitioning by V would change
#     the clustering entirely.
#
# Args:  <input.csv> <out_dir> [n_cores] [fast_threshold]

# --- patched gliph2 (empty-reference crash fix) --------------------------------------------------
# turboGliph's global step crashes on narrow partitions whose CDR3 structs don't overlap the naive
# reference DB: ref_stats is built as an empty double-typed frame, so dplyr's strict join on `tag`
# aborts ("y$tag is a <double>"). The fast path can produce such partitions, and a crash would
# silently drop that partition's edges. gliph2_patched.R is turboGliph 0.99.2's gliph2() with three
# minimal edits (type the empty ref_stats + coerce the two sample-vs-reference join keys to
# character). Loaded into an env parented on turboGliph's namespace so every internal call resolves
# exactly as the installed function would. Falls back to the stock gliph2() if the patch is absent.
